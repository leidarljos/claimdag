# Changelog

Versions follow semver at 0.x: a minor bump is a feature, a patch is a fix.

## 0.6.2 (2026-09-20)

- The how-to names the tools the server serves; `claimdag_complete` is
  titled as what it does; the architecture page names the ratatui pane.

## 0.6.0 (2026-09-12)

- `reopen ID [--actor ID]` and `claimdag_reopen`: a terminal node comes
  back to ready with the generation moved, so a tracker id that maps to
  one node can be sat on again. The ledger keeps the earlier completion.

## 0.5.0 (2026-09-12)

- `release ID [--actor ID]` and the MCP `claimdag_release`: hand one claim
  back before the work is terminal. Ready again, assignee cleared,
  generation moved. A holder that stops without it stays busy until the
  lease runs out.

## 0.4.0 (2026-09-12)

What a user gets:

- One mutator across processes: every command line and server call that
  changes the graph takes an advisory lock on the graph directory from load
  to save, so two workers claiming at once cannot lose each other's change.
- Leases: `reclaim --lease SECS` hands back every claim quiet for longer, and
  the generation moves so a stale holder is fenced at `complete --gen`.
- Critical path: the MCP `claimdag_ready` orders ready nodes by the work
  waiting below them, under a millisecond at four thousand nodes.
- `list --json`, `archive`, `unarchive`; the pane hands back stale claims
  with one key.
- A documentation site at https://leidarljos.github.io/claimdag/.

## 0.3.0

Compare-and-swap claims over a work graph with a Cap'n Proto snapshot.
