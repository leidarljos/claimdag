One writer. Unpacked Cap'n on disk. Hosts mmap ``work.bin``.

Law
===

-  The host process is the sole mutator.
-  The schema is claimdag's. This crate has no RPC surface.
-  Ids are 128-bit ``WorkId``. Kind, status, and role are closed enums.
-  Summary is the only open text field.
-  Terminal status is sticky. ``archive`` is a flag, not a status.

Not a record
============

claimdag holds the work one host process is handing out now. The snapshot lives
in the runtime directory, is capped at 4096 nodes, and prunes finished work to
stay under the cap. Nothing here outlives the session that wrote it.

A plain-text issue tracker models the same shape: parent, hard dependency,
holder, derived workable set, sticky terminal state. The two are not redundant,
because the tempos differ. A record is edited by people and kept in version
control. A scheduler is compare-and-swap over an mmap. The rule for picking is
the tempo: if the answer has to survive the session, it belongs in the tracker.

A ``WorkNode`` therefore has no field for a deed accession and is not getting one.
An accession crosses durable stores. A graph that prunes its own finished nodes
cannot be an end of a citation without lying about it later. A node names what
it schedules instead, by opening ``summary`` with the tracker id. That is a
convention and not a schema change.

Split

========================= ===============================
Piece                     Role
========================= ===============================
``schema/claimdag.capnp`` Snap / node / id
``crates/claimdag``       DAG, CAS, mmap load
``crates/claimdag-cli``   ``claimdag`` over a directory
``claimdag_tui``          Textual tree; mutations via CLI
========================= ===============================

Disk
====

-  Write: atomic replace of ``$dir/work.bin`` (unpacked Cap'n).
-  Read: mmap ``work.bin``.
-  Default ``list`` / TUI: live nodes only (not terminal, not archived).

Not this crate
==============

This crate is the team DAG only. Memory and ledger stores stay out.
